# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

## How to use

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You will use Express to handle routing.


You will be asked 10 questions to figure out which one of my favorite tv characters you are. 
Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

After you answer all the questions your results will just pop up and show you who your friend match is.
